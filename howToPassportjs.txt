installed passport lib - > installed passport local - > created a new strategy and allocated it to middleware -> 
(done is the callback function) -> serialize user(picks out the info from the user which needs to be set in the session cookie)
-> deserialize (picks out id from the session cookie and converting it into the user )
-> check auth basically a function which checks if the user is authenticated
->set authenticatedUser to access the auth user in the views


IN index.js
set the passport.setAuthenticatedUser so to set it every time the passport is initialized

Express session 
initialized it -> used the session to store the session data using mongo-store in db 


IN routes.js
created route to sign in using passport.authenticated('local'...blah blah)
